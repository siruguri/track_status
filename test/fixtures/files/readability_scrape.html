In 1887&#x2013;8, August Strindberg wrote the experimental autobiographical novel <i>Le 
Plaidoyer d&#x2019;un fou</i>; but only now is it available in a translation 
taken directly from the author&#x2019;s original manuscript, lost shortly after its 
first publication in Paris in 1895. The manuscript resurfaced in 1973 in the 
safe of the Anatomy department of Oslo University &#x2013; a curious location 
rendered curiouser when you remember that Strindberg, a Swede, never visited 
Norway. 
</p><p>
Throughout his life, Strindberg wrote a series of autobiographies that shared 
no common style or language, each aiming at &#x201C;an analysis of the soul or 
psychological anatomy&#x201D; that was truthful to himself at the particular moment 
of writing. The whole was deliberately designed to display the discontinuity 
of his &#x201C;evolution as a human being&#x201D; and as a writer. <i>Plaidoyer</i> 
was written as Strindberg was approaching forty. He wrote it in French, 
hoping Paris would be receptive to a new form of literature &#x201C;more realistic 
than Flaubert, more experimental than Zola&#x201D;. It was to be the opposite of 
the French tradition of the novelist-observer reporting elegantly on the 
human condition, the reverse of a neat encapsulation of experience. Written 
in the first person, it recorded his tortured ambivalence during the 
thirteen years of his adoring passion for his first wife, Siri von Essen. 
While writing it, Strindberg was reading the latest literature by the 
foremost experimental psychologists: Henry Maudsley and Th&#xE9;odule-Armand 
Ribot on the pathology of the mind, Hippolyte Bernheim on &#x201C;suggestion&#x201D; &#x2013; the 
witch-doctorish power of one mind to subject another to its will &#x2013; and 
Freud&#x2019;s teacher Jean-Martin Charcot (known as &#x201C;the Napoleon of the 
neuroses&#x201D;), on female hysteria. All of them were thinkers ideally suited to 
Strindberg&#x2019;s subject matter: obsessive love. 
</p><p>
What plot there is in <i>Plaidoyer</i> charts the ten-year marriage following 
the <i>coup de foudre</i> that poleaxed the twenty-six-year-old commoner, 
struggling as an actor and writer, on meeting the blue eyes of Siri, a 
stage-struck actress and married baroness. Siri and her husband seem to 
connive at drawing Strindberg into their marriage. The baron introduces 
Siri&#x2019;s pretty young cousin into the house as his mistress. Strindberg is 
obliquely invited to complete the quartet. Ambiguity reigns. Lesbianism 
whispers softly in the shadows. Strindberg becomes prey to the certainty 
that his rigid lower-class moral code is being undermined by the 
sophisticated flexibility of the confident aristocrats. Siri is willing to 
risk ruin for a career on the stage. She leaves her doll&#x2019;s house, divorces 
the baron and marries Strindberg, who permits her to live the liberated life 
of sexual equality they both believe in. They write a feminist manifesto. 
She becomes an actress; smokes, drinks, treats everyone of both sexes with 
the same uninhibited even-handedness. He is disappointed that liberation 
leads her to behave as licentiously as a man. His suspicion over small 
incidents, which at first he recounts humorously as farcical vicissitudes, 
grows into jealousy, then full-blown paranoia as he interprets her 
unfettered behaviour, first as promiscuity, then as nymphomania. Who is 
right ? Who is wrong? Who is lying? Who is mad? The reader has no idea, and 
their violent clashes sweep headlong into tragedy. When at last Strindberg 
wrings a confession of sexual infidelity out of Siri, he wonders &#x2013; even 
while beating her up &#x2013; whether her confession is true or if it is designed 
to drive him mad so she can gain total power by committing him to an asylum.

</p><p>
The question has always been whether Strindberg crossed the line into insanity 
during the six months it took him to write the book. He said himself he had 
no idea. While writing it, he visited Knud Pontoppidan, a famous mind 
doctor, to be certified sane (Pontoppidan refused to pronounce unless 
Strindberg gave him more time, a commodity Strindberg couldn&#x2019;t spare). 
Strindberg described the six months of writing as if fiction and reality 
were indistinguishable, as if he were walking in his sleep with the feeling 
that if he discovered what was art, and what life, he would go insane or 
commit suicide through a sick conscience. Siri&#x2019;s response to <i>Plaidoyer</i> 
was: &#x201C;It&#x2019;s all true and not true . . . there is scarcely an incident in it 
that does not have some foundation in fact &#x2013; only everything is so horribly 
twisted and distorted&#x201D;. 
</p><p>
Even Strindberg realized the book should not be published during Siri&#x2019;s 
lifetime. He deposited the manuscript with his cousin, J. O. Strindberg, to 
keep until after his death. Five years passed. Then Strindberg learned that 
Gustaf af Geijerstam was planning to write about the stormy marriage. If 
anyone was going to tell the story, it was to be Strindberg, who was by now 
divorced from Siri and married to Frida Uhl, the Austrian femme fatale and 
hustler. He recovered the manuscript and a handwritten copy of it was made 
and sent to the German publisher Albert Langen. Dr Wilhelm K&#xE4;mpf translated 
it into German, possibly with some input from Emil Schering, and this was 
published in Berlin in 1893 under the title <i>Die Beichte eines Thoren</i>. 
Its prosecution for obscenity was probably an attempt by Frida to drum up 
publicity. The copy manuscript was lost so we have no idea whether the 
considerable deviations from Strindberg&#x2019;s original were due to the 
translator or the editor. 
</p><p>
Two years later, Albert Langen decided the opportune moment had come to 
publish the book in French. Paris could not get enough of things 
Scandinavian: Strindberg&#x2019;s <i>Miss Julie</i> was taking the theatre by 
storm, Ibsen&#x2019;s &#x201C;woman question&#x201D; plays were all the rage, and Edvard Munch 
had overtaken Vincent Van Gogh in addressing the urgent question of how to 
portray pathological states of mind in paintings such as &#x201C;Anguish&#x201D;, 
&#x201C;Jealousy&#x201D;, &#x201C;Vampire&#x201D; and &#x201C;Scream&#x201D;. <i>Plaidoyer</i> 
captured the zeitgeist. Langen published it in 1895 and the Strindbergs 
moved to Paris where Langen&#x2019;s secretary, Frank Wedekind, impregnated Frida 
(that was the end of that marriage) and Langen&#x2019;s crony, the Danish con man 
Willy Gr&#xE9;tor, stole and sold Strindberg&#x2019;s paintings. Munch exhibited 
&#x201C;Scream&#x201D; and Strindberg reviewed it for <i>La Revue blanche</i>. 
The publication of <i>Plaidoyer</i> was a <i>succ&#xE8;s d&#x2019;estime</i> 
but it brought in no money. Poorer than ever, Strindberg turned to alchemy, 
but gold never formed in the crucible and the chemicals exacerbated his 
paranoia to such an extent that when he sat for Munch&#x2019;s famous lithographic 
portrait of 1896, he wordlessly laid down a revolver between them. Shortly 
after, he broke off the friendship forever, accusing Munch of trying to 
murder him. A couple of months after publication, Strindberg sold the 
manuscript at auction, after which it disappeared. 
</p><p>
Then, in 1973, the packet was discovered during a tidy-up of the Anatomy 
department of Oslo University. On the outside were written the names &#x201C;K. E. 
Schreiner&#x201D; and &#x201C;Johs. Roede&#x201D; and &#x201C;Strindberg, Confession d&#x2019;un sot&#x201D;. Sverre 
Flugsrud of Oslo&#x2019;s Nasjonalbibliotek embarked on detective work. &#x201C;Confession 
d&#x2019;un sot&#x201D; was one of the titles Strindberg considered for the book. Roede 
was Edvard Munch&#x2019;s lawyer; he mentions the manuscript in his book <i>Edvard 
Munch som vi kjente ham, vennene forteller</i> (1946; Edvard Munch as We 
Knew Him: Friends recollect). Schreiner was Professor of Anatomy at Oslo 
University and Munch&#x2019;s personal physician; he went through Munch&#x2019;s papers 
after his death, keeping them in the safe of the Anatomy department and 
transferring them to the City of Oslo Art Collections in the late 1940s. We 
do not know why the packet was left behind. Nor do we know why Munch bought 
the manuscript. Presumably it was simply a tactful method of pushing some 
money Strindberg&#x2019;s way.

</p><p>
The discovery of the Oslo manuscript revealed the extent of the revisions 
Georges Loiseau made for Langen&#x2019;s French edition of 1895, on which, together 
with the earlier German edition, all subsequent versions and translations 
were based. Strindberg structured the book into four long, unbroken parts, 
allowing the intensity to mount at a furious pace. But Loiseau chopped it 
into lots of short chapters, breaking up the juggernaut rhythm and 
destructive inevitability. He also cleaned up Strindberg&#x2019;s headlong, 
inaccurate French into measured prose that could never have been written by 
anyone out of their mind with jealousy. Take the opening paragraph. Oslo 
manuscript: &#x201C;C&#x2019;est le treize Mai 1875 &#xE0; Stockholm. Je me voi d&#x2019;ici &#xE0; la 
Biblioth&#xE8;que . . . . L&#x2019;immense pi&#xE8;ce . . . s&#x2019;ouvre sous mes pieds comme un 
gouffre, singeant avec les cents milles volumes qu&#x2019;elle renferme un cerveau 
gigantesque o&#xF9; se rangement par cases les id&#xE9;es des g&#xE9;n&#xE9;rations pass&#xE9;es&#x201D;. 
Loiseau, 1895: &#x201C;C&#x2019;&#xE9;tait le 13 Mai 1875 &#xE0; Stockholm. Je me vois encore &#xE0; la 
Biblioth&#xE8;que . . . . L&#x2019;immense hall . . . s&#x2019;ouvre b&#xE9;ant, ainsi qu&#x2019;un 
gouffre, sous mes pieds, image, avec les cent milles volumes qu&#x2019;il renferme, 
d&#x2019;un cerveau gigantesque o&#xF9; les id&#xE9;es des g&#xE9;n&#xE9;rations disparues seraient 
rang&#xE9;es par cases&#x201D;. 
</p><p>
<i>The Defence of a Madman </i>is now translated from the Oslo manuscript by 
Carol Sanders and Janet Garton. Their afterword is a model of its kind, 
demonstrating the detailed care they have taken over the dilemmas faced by 
translators that hardly need rehearsing, so extensively and recently have 
they been discussed in this paper in connection with Proust. Faithful to 
Strindberg&#x2019;s syntax wherever possible and preserving the vitality and 
occasional mayhem of the original, they have restored his idiosyncratic 
choice of words and his multilingual playfulness. Here we recognize the 
Strindberg who liked no place better than the brink of chaos, who 
deliberately untuned his guitar strings to see what music would result, and 
who was hailed by Gide, Sartre and Camus as prefiguring Freud and 
Existentialism. 
</p><p>
Perhaps a future edition might include the novel&#x2019;s tortuous publication 
history, so little known as it is to an English audience and so 
self-fulfilling in terms of Strindberg&#x2019;s own theory of the future of 
culture, set down in his influential essay of 1894, &#x201C;The New Arts! or the 
Role of Chance in Artistic Creation&#x201D;, which argues that artworks are 
constantly alive, evolving and responding to change through chance. And it 
is by chance that the original <i>Plaidoyer</i> manuscript now sits in 
Oslo&#x2019;s National Library where it can be examined physically or online in 
electronic facsimile at www.nb.no. The 363-page account of an emotional 
maelstrom set down in Strindberg&#x2019;s small, neat hand seems to argue that 
insanity didn&#x2019;t come into it at all: he knew exactly what he was doing. <span><br></span>
