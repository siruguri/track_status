This week&#x2019;s issue also features cotton capitalism, modern \nart as &#x201C;crypto-relic&#x201D;, two Sweeney Todds, one new poem by Clive James &#x2013; and \nmuch more.</i></b>\n</p><p>\nIn 1887&#x2013;8, August Strindberg wrote the experimental autobiographical novel <i>Le \nPlaidoyer d&#x2019;un fou</i>; but only now is it available in a translation \ntaken directly from the author&#x2019;s original manuscript, lost shortly after its \nfirst publication in Paris in 1895. The manuscript resurfaced in 1973 in the \nsafe of the Anatomy department of Oslo University &#x2013; a curious location \nrendered curiouser when you remember that Strindberg, a Swede, never visited \nNorway. \n</p><p>\nThroughout his life, Strindberg wrote a series of autobiographies that shared \nno common style or language, each aiming at &#x201C;an analysis of the soul or \npsychological anatomy&#x201D; that was truthful to himself at the particular moment \nof writing. The whole was deliberately designed to display the discontinuity \nof his &#x201C;evolution as a human being&#x201D; and as a writer. <i>Plaidoyer</i> \nwas written as Strindberg was approaching forty. He wrote it in French, \nhoping Paris would be receptive to a new form of literature &#x201C;more realistic \nthan Flaubert, more experimental than Zola&#x201D;. It was to be the opposite of \nthe French tradition of the novelist-observer reporting elegantly on the \nhuman condition, the reverse of a neat encapsulation of experience. Written \nin the first person, it recorded his tortured ambivalence during the \nthirteen years of his adoring passion for his first wife, Siri von Essen. \nWhile writing it, Strindberg was reading the latest literature by the \nforemost experimental psychologists: Henry Maudsley and Th&#xE9;odule-Armand \nRibot on the pathology of the mind, Hippolyte Bernheim on &#x201C;suggestion&#x201D; &#x2013; the \nwitch-doctorish power of one mind to subject another to its will &#x2013; and \nFreud&#x2019;s teacher Jean-Martin Charcot (known as &#x201C;the Napoleon of the \nneuroses&#x201D;), on female hysteria. All of them were thinkers ideally suited to \nStrindberg&#x2019;s subject matter: obsessive love. \n</p><p>\nWhat plot there is in <i>Plaidoyer</i> charts the ten-year marriage following \nthe <i>coup de foudre</i> that poleaxed the twenty-six-year-old commoner, \nstruggling as an actor and writer, on meeting the blue eyes of Siri, a \nstage-struck actress and married baroness. Siri and her husband seem to \nconnive at drawing Strindberg into their marriage. The baron introduces \nSiri&#x2019;s pretty young cousin into the house as his mistress. Strindberg is \nobliquely invited to complete the quartet. Ambiguity reigns. Lesbianism \nwhispers softly in the shadows. Strindberg becomes prey to the certainty \nthat his rigid lower-class moral code is being undermined by the \nsophisticated flexibility of the confident aristocrats. Siri is willing to \nrisk ruin for a career on the stage. She leaves her doll&#x2019;s house, divorces \nthe baron and marries Strindberg, who permits her to live the liberated life \nof sexual equality they both believe in. They write a feminist manifesto. \nShe becomes an actress; smokes, drinks, treats everyone of both sexes with \nthe same uninhibited even-handedness. He is disappointed that liberation \nleads her to behave as licentiously as a man. His suspicion over small \nincidents, which at first he recounts humorously as farcical vicissitudes, \ngrows into jealousy, then full-blown paranoia as he interprets her \nunfettered behaviour, first as promiscuity, then as nymphomania. Who is \nright ? Who is wrong? Who is lying? Who is mad? The reader has no idea, and \ntheir violent clashes sweep headlong into tragedy. When at last Strindberg \nwrings a confession of sexual infidelity out of Siri, he wonders &#x2013; even \nwhile beating her up &#x2013; whether her confession is true or if it is designed \nto drive him mad so she can gain total power by committing him to an asylum. \n</p><p>\n<span class=\"quote quote-left\"><span class=\"quote-text\">\nIt was to be the opposite of the French tradition of the novelist-observer \nreporting elegantly on the human condition, the reverse of a neat \nencapsulation of experience </span></span>\n</p><p>\nThe question has always been whether Strindberg crossed the line into insanity \nduring the six months it took him to write the book. He said himself he had \nno idea. While writing it, he visited Knud Pontoppidan, a famous mind \ndoctor, to be certified sane (Pontoppidan refused to pronounce unless \nStrindberg gave him more time, a commodity Strindberg couldn&#x2019;t spare). \nStrindberg described the six months of writing as if fiction and reality \nwere indistinguishable, as if he were walking in his sleep with the feeling \nthat if he discovered what was art, and what life, he would go insane or \ncommit suicide through a sick conscience. Siri&#x2019;s response to <i>Plaidoyer</i> \nwas: &#x201C;It&#x2019;s all true and not true . . . there is scarcely an incident in it \nthat does not have some foundation in fact &#x2013; only everything is so horribly \ntwisted and distorted&#x201D;. \n</p><p>\nEven Strindberg realized the book should not be published during Siri&#x2019;s \nlifetime. He deposited the manuscript with his cousin, J. O. Strindberg, to \nkeep until after his death. Five years passed. Then Strindberg learned that \nGustaf af Geijerstam was planning to write about the stormy marriage. If \nanyone was going to tell the story, it was to be Strindberg, who was by now \ndivorced from Siri and married to Frida Uhl, the Austrian femme fatale and \nhustler. He recovered the manuscript and a handwritten copy of it was made \nand sent to the German publisher Albert Langen. Dr Wilhelm K&#xE4;mpf translated \nit into German, possibly with some input from Emil Schering, and this was \npublished in Berlin in 1893 under the title <i>Die Beichte eines Thoren</i>. \nIts prosecution for obscenity was probably an attempt by Frida to drum up \npublicity. The copy manuscript was lost so we have no idea whether the \nconsiderable deviations from Strindberg&#x2019;s original were due to the \ntranslator or the editor. \n</p><p>\nTwo years later, Albert Langen decided the opportune moment had come to \npublish the book in French. Paris could not get enough of things \nScandinavian: Strindberg&#x2019;s <i>Miss Julie</i> was taking the theatre by \nstorm, Ibsen&#x2019;s &#x201C;woman question&#x201D; plays were all the rage, and Edvard Munch \nhad overtaken Vincent Van Gogh in addressing the urgent question of how to \nportray pathological states of mind in paintings such as &#x201C;Anguish&#x201D;, \n&#x201C;Jealousy&#x201D;, &#x201C;Vampire&#x201D; and &#x201C;Scream&#x201D;. <i>Plaidoyer</i> \ncaptured the zeitgeist. Langen published it in 1895 and the Strindbergs \nmoved to Paris where Langen&#x2019;s secretary, Frank Wedekind, impregnated Frida \n(that was the end of that marriage) and Langen&#x2019;s crony, the Danish con man \nWilly Gr&#xE9;tor, stole and sold Strindberg&#x2019;s paintings. Munch exhibited \n&#x201C;Scream&#x201D; and Strindberg reviewed it for <i>La Revue blanche</i>. \nThe publication of <i>Plaidoyer</i> was a <i>succ&#xE8;s d&#x2019;estime</i> \nbut it brought in no money. Poorer than ever, Strindberg turned to alchemy, \nbut gold never formed in the crucible and the chemicals exacerbated his \nparanoia to such an extent that when he sat for Munch&#x2019;s famous lithographic \nportrait of 1896, he wordlessly laid down a revolver between them. Shortly \nafter, he broke off the friendship forever, accusing Munch of trying to \nmurder him. A couple of months after publication, Strindberg sold the \nmanuscript at auction, after which it disappeared. \n</p><p>\nThen, in 1973, the packet was discovered during a tidy-up of the Anatomy \ndepartment of Oslo University. On the outside were written the names &#x201C;K. E. \nSchreiner&#x201D; and &#x201C;Johs. Roede&#x201D; and &#x201C;Strindberg, Confession d&#x2019;un sot&#x201D;. Sverre \nFlugsrud of Oslo&#x2019;s Nasjonalbibliotek embarked on detective work. &#x201C;Confession \nd&#x2019;un sot&#x201D; was one of the titles Strindberg considered for the book. Roede \nwas Edvard Munch&#x2019;s lawyer; he mentions the manuscript in his book <i>Edvard \nMunch som vi kjente ham, vennene forteller</i> (1946; Edvard Munch as We \nKnew Him: Friends recollect). Schreiner was Professor of Anatomy at Oslo \nUniversity and Munch&#x2019;s personal physician; he went through Munch&#x2019;s papers \nafter his death, keeping them in the safe of the Anatomy department and \ntransferring them to the City of Oslo Art Collections in the late 1940s. We \ndo not know why the packet was left behind. Nor do we know why Munch bought \nthe manuscript. Presumably it was simply a tactful method of pushing some \nmoney Strindberg&#x2019;s way. \n</p><p>\n<span class=\"quote quote-right\"><span class=\"quote-text\">\nStrindberg structured the book into four long, unbroken parts, allowing the intensity \nto mount at a furious pace</span></span>\n</p><p>\nThe discovery of the Oslo manuscript revealed the extent of the revisions \nGeorges Loiseau made for Langen&#x2019;s French edition of 1895, on which, together \nwith the earlier German edition, all subsequent versions and translations \nwere based. Strindberg structured the book into four long, unbroken parts, \nallowing the intensity to mount at a furious pace. But Loiseau chopped it \ninto lots of short chapters, breaking up the juggernaut rhythm and \ndestructive inevitability. He also cleaned up Strindberg&#x2019;s headlong, \ninaccurate French into measured prose that could never have been written by \nanyone out of their mind with jealousy. Take the opening paragraph. Oslo \nmanuscript: &#x201C;C&#x2019;est le treize Mai 1875 &#xE0; Stockholm. Je me voi d&#x2019;ici &#xE0; la \nBiblioth&#xE8;que . . . . L&#x2019;immense pi&#xE8;ce . . . s&#x2019;ouvre sous mes pieds comme un \ngouffre, singeant avec les cents milles volumes qu&#x2019;elle renferme un cerveau \ngigantesque o&#xF9; se rangement par cases les id&#xE9;es des g&#xE9;n&#xE9;rations pass&#xE9;es&#x201D;. \nLoiseau, 1895: &#x201C;C&#x2019;&#xE9;tait le 13 Mai 1875 &#xE0; Stockholm. Je me vois encore &#xE0; la \nBiblioth&#xE8;que . . . . L&#x2019;immense hall . . . s&#x2019;ouvre b&#xE9;ant, ainsi qu&#x2019;un \ngouffre, sous mes pieds, image, avec les cent milles volumes qu&#x2019;il renferme, \nd&#x2019;un cerveau gigantesque o&#xF9; les id&#xE9;es des g&#xE9;n&#xE9;rations disparues seraient \nrang&#xE9;es par cases&#x201D;. \n</p><p>\n<i>The Defence of a Madman </i>is now translated from the Oslo manuscript by \nCarol Sanders and Janet Garton. Their afterword is a model of its kind, \ndemonstrating the detailed care they have taken over the dilemmas faced by \ntranslators that hardly need rehearsing, so extensively and recently have \nthey been discussed in this paper in connection with Proust. Faithful to \nStrindberg&#x2019;s syntax wherever possible and preserving the vitality and \noccasional mayhem of the original, they have restored his idiosyncratic \nchoice of words and his multilingual playfulness. Here we recognize the \nStrindberg who liked no place better than the brink of chaos, who \ndeliberately untuned his guitar strings to see what music would result, and \nwho was hailed by Gide, Sartre and Camus as prefiguring Freud and \nExistentialism. \n</p><p>\nPerhaps a future edition might include the novel&#x2019;s tortuous publication \nhistory, so little known as it is to an English audience and so \nself-fulfilling in terms of Strindberg&#x2019;s own theory of the future of \nculture, set down in his influential essay of 1894, &#x201C;The New Arts! or the \nRole of Chance in Artistic Creation&#x201D;, which argues that artworks are \nconstantly alive, evolving and responding to change through chance. And it \nis by chance that the original <i>Plaidoyer</i> manuscript now sits in \nOslo&#x2019;s National Library where it can be examined physically or online in \nelectronic facsimile at www.nb.no. The 363-page account of an emotional \nmaelstrom set down in Strindberg&#x2019;s small, neat hand seems to argue that \ninsanity didn&#x2019;t come into it at all: he knew exactly what he was doing. <span><br></span>\n<span><br></span>\n<span><br></span>\n<b>Sue Prideaux</b>&#x2019;s books include <i>Edvard Munch: Behind the Scream</i>, \nwhich won the James Tait Black Biography Prize in 2005, and <i>Strindberg: A \nLife</i>, which won the Pol Roger Duff Cooper Prize in 2012. \n</p>\n</div>\n\n</div>",
